### **Assessment Details**

### **Part 1: Basic Catalog Input for Impact Data**

You will create a basic interface and API in the framework of your choice (Typescript) where product impact data can be entered and managed based on their interpretation of the provided screenshot. The system should be designed to handle the complexities of product data effectively and intuitively.

### **Key Points to Address:**

1. **Data Interpretation**:
    - Analyze the provided screenshot to identify relevant product attributes
    - Decide which attributes has to be collected directly from the user and which can be computed or derived.
    - Define the database schema (Postgres)
2. **Form Design and Data Collection**:
    - Design a user interface for data input that is intuitive and aligns with the identified attributes.
    - Implement form validation and error handling to ensure data integrity.
3. **Database Design**:
    - Design a data schema that supports the storage, retrieval, and management of the product data.
    - Choose appropriate technologies for data handling and persistence based on the application's needs.
